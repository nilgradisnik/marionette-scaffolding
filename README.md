# marionette-scaffolding
  
  marionette-scaffolding a fairly simple web application skeleton(boilerplate or whatever you want to call it) using Backbone.js in combination with Marionette.js and few other helpful libraries. I also put the minimal Node.js server for testing the web app. It's meant to be a helpful starting point for new web projects.

## Web app

  The `public` folder containes all the files that will get you started

## Server

  The `server` folder contains simple Node.js server. You'll find more info on how to run in and install dependencies there
